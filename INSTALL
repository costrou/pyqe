# Installation 
Only works with python 3! Sorry python 2 users. Python
3 was released in 2009 it is time to move foreward.

I only work on a linux machine (maybe works on OSX and Windows)

Install for all users (sudo = superuser command)
`sudo python3 setup.py install`

Install locally
`python3 setup.py install --user`
